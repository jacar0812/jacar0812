<h1>Hi, I'm Jeremy, an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-mason-a34659b7">aspiring IT and Cloud Security professional</a></h1>

I'm a dedicated cloud computing and cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in the finance industry. After nearly a decade in that field, I found my true passion in IT and shifted focus to dive into cloud technology. I’m committed to continuous learning and skill development, especially through hands-on projects, lab work, and experimenting with platforms like Azure and AWS.

This documents my journey as I apply new knowledge, tackle real-world scenarios, and work toward becoming a Cloud Security Engineer. Thanks for visiting, and feel free to connect if you’re interested in collaborating or discussing cloud and security topics!
